    "A nice pattern could be to define a function that accepts the target year and a filepath as an argument and then checks at the specified filepath for a file corresponding to the dataset you are going to download. If it exists, it could immediately open up the file and return the saved contents. If not, it could download the contents from the REST API and save it to the file before returning the data. This means that the first time you run this function, it will automatically download and cache the data locally, and the next time you run the same function, it will instead load the local data. Consider using environment variables to allow each teammate to specify different locations, and having your function automatically retrieve the location specified by the environment variable so you donâ€™t have to fight about paths in your git repository.\n"
