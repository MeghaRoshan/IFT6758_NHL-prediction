## 1 - Data Acquisition

### Downloading data tutorial
A nice pattern could be to define a function that accepts the target year as an argument and then checks at the specified filepath for a file corresponding to the dataset you are going to download. If it exists, it could immediately open up the file and return the saved contents. If not, it could download the contents from the REST API and save it to the file before returning the data. This means that the first time you run this function, it will automatically download and cache the data locally, and the next time you run the same function, it will instead load the local data.

seasons: 2016,2017,2018,2019,2020 02 = regular season, 03 = playoffs,

The first 4 digits identify the season of the game (ie. 2017 for the 2017-2018 season). The next 2 digits give the type of game, where 01 = preseason, 02 = regular season, 03 = playoffs, 04 = all-star. The final 4 digits identify the specific game number. For regular season and preseason games, this ranges from 0001 to the number of games played. (1271 for seasons with 31 teams (2017 and onwards) and 1230 for seasons with 30 teams). For playoff games, the 2nd digit of the specific number gives the round of the playoffs, the 3rd digit specifies the matchup, and the 4th digit specifies the game (out of 7).

regular: combinations formed for 2016: year/02/0001to1230 combinations formed for 2017se2020: year/02/0001to1271

playoff: combinations formed for: year/03/four digits digit1=0 digit2=1/2/3/4 digit3=1-6/1-4/1-2/1 digit4=1/2/3/4/5/6/
The following code is used to downloaded the data.

```python
import pandas as pd
import requests
import pickle
import os
def gameIdListExtraction(year) :
    """Return a list of all gameID for regular and playoffs seasons from 2016 to 2021 ,
    that we will use in the next function to extract data of each gameID.

    :param year: season year
    :type year: int

    :rtype: list
    :return: list of gameIds
    """
    season_type = ['02', '03' ]  # 02 is the indicator for regular season and 03 for playoffs season
    gameIdList = [] # list of all game id from  2016 to 2021
    for season in season_type :
        if season =='02' :
            if year == 2016 :
                for i in range(1230) :  # the regularseason 2016/2017 contains more games than the other seasons
                    game_number ="%04d" % i
                    gameIdList += [str(year)+season  + game_number]
            else :
                for i in range(1271) :
                    game_number ="%04d" % i
                    gameIdList += [str(year)+season  + game_number]
        else :
            for digit2 in range(1,5):
                for digit3 in range(1,8):
                    for digit4 in range(1,8):
                        game_number ="0"+str(digit2)+str(digit3)+str(digit4)
                        gameIdList +=[str(year)+season + game_number]
    return gameIdList

```

An example of using it to extract the data of the season 2016/2017 is :
```python
def dataDownload(year) :
    game_data = []
    gameIdList = gameIdListExtraction(year)
    if  os.path.exists('./'+str(year)+'FullDataset.pkl') :
        print('file already exsiste')
    else :
        for i in gameIdList :
            r = requests.get(url='http://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/' + i+'/feed/live')
            data = r.json()
            game_data.append(data)

        with open('./'+str(year)+'FullDataset.pkl', 'wb') as f:
            pickle.dump(game_data, f, pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)
    return
```

```python
from ift6758.data.data_Acquisition import dataDownload
years = (2016, 2017,2018,2019,2020,2021)
for i in years :
    dataDownload(i)
```

## 3 - Tidy Data
### Final dataset
![3-1](/assets/figure3_1.png)
###  “strength” field discussion
In order to compute the strength for any shot/goal, we can use the coordinates from which the shot/goal was taken.
In addition to this, we'll have to measure the time taken to cover the distance from the place where the goal/shot
was taken to the goal post/net of the other team.
This time can be computed by subtracting the time when the goal/shot was initiated from the time when the shot was
blocked (or the time when the goal happens, in case of a goal).
On dividing the distance by time, we will get the speed or strength in mles/sec or feet/sec.
Also, we can assign numbers to a group of speed and cal it a stength meter or measure.
For eg: 100miles/hr can be termed as the best strength can can be denoted as 10/10.
         90-80 miles/hr can be assigned to 9/10 strength and similarly 80-90 miles/hr can be assgigned as 8/10 strength.
### Additional features
The three additional features we could consider creating from the data available in this dataset are:

Strength meter: As discussed in the previous question, we can divide the distance obtained from the coordinates
of the goal/shot with the time taken to cover the goal/shot to obtain the speed by which the shot/goal was hit.
We can also provide a measure to various intervals of speed.

success or failure of an event: We can assign success or failure of an event to interpret if the failure of an event affets the nect event happening after it.
We can also find out if a failure of a goal around the time of completion of the game puts the striker team in a stressful situtaion leading to penalties in the
next event.

Player's performace in previous games: We can also use the number of matches played by a player along with his/her strength in those games to predict his/her performance.
If a player has been playing too many matches in the recent couple of matches and if the strength meter is declining, then maybe he/she might need a rehabilitation or break to regain the strength.

## 4 - Simple Visualizations
### Shot types over all teams comparaison
{% include fig1.html %}

{% include fig2.html %}
From the first graph, we can see that the wrist shot was the most used
shot by the team in the 2021/2022 season, with around 50k attempts.
However, this is not the most dangerous shot.
We notice, from the second graph,
we can see that the "tip-in" percentage of goals is about 17%.
whereas , the percentage rate of "wrist shot" is only 9%.
### relationship between the distance a shot was taken and the chance it was a goal
{% include fig3.html %}

{% include fig4.html %}

{% include fig5.html %}

{% include fig6.html %}
Comparing goal difference in shots, the three seasons from 2018 to 2021 are fairly similar.
Note that we chose not to use shot/goal data beyond 90 feet.
This is because the number of shots is too small to represent the goal/shot conversion rate.
### goal percentage
{% include fig7.html %}

{% include fig8.html %}

{% include fig9.html %}

{% include fig10.html %}
Using the plots above, we can observe different ratios of shots to goals
scored for the 2018-2019 season based on two parameters: distance of shots
 and type of shot attempted.
As with the configuration where the number of shots does not exceed 30,
we repeat that we chose not to include shots over 90 feet. These may represent
very high percentages and are not representative of the entire season.
Then, thanks to the heatmap graphics presented.The dangerous type of shots might be , from the plots, the deflected and tip in
## 5 - Advanced Visualizations: Shot Maps

```python
def plotShotMap(season_year, team, df):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(13,8.5),facecolor='w', edgecolor='k')

    season_games = dataframesCombination(df,team )
    img = plt.imread('../figures/nhl_rink.png')

    ext = [-100, 100, -42.5, 42.5]
    plt.imshow(img, zorder=0, extent=ext, aspect=1)
    # Generate some test data
    [x,y] = np.round(np.meshgrid(np.linspace(0,100,100),np.linspace(-42.5,42.5,85)))
    excessShotRate = griddata((season_games['x_bin'],season_games['y_bin']),season_games['excessShotRate'],(x,y),method='cubic',fill_value=0)
    excessShotRate = np.where(excessShotRate < 0,0,excessShotRate)


    img = gaussian_filter(excessShotRate, sigma=4)
    img = ax.imshow(img, extent=[0, 100, -42.5, 42.5], origin='lower', cmap='bwr', alpha=0.5 )#, clim=(-1, 1))

    cbar = plt.colorbar(img, ax=ax, pad = 0.05)
    cbar.ax.set_ylabel('Excess Shots per 1 feet', rotation=270, labelpad=20)
    ax.set_title(f"Shot map of {team} - season {season_year}/{season_year+1}")

    plt.show()
```

```python
@interact(
    season_year=widgets.IntSlider(min=2016, max=2021, step=1),
)
def show_data(season_year):
    season_games = selectDataFrame(season_year)

    @interact(
    team=teamList(season_year))
    def data(team) :
        print('Number of teams :' , len(team))
        plotShotMap(season_year, team, season_games)
        display(season_games.head())
