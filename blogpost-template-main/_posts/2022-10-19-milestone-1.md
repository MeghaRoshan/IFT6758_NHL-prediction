## 1 - Data Acquisition

### Downloading data tutorial
A nice pattern could be to define a function that accepts the target year and a filepath as an argument and then checks at the specified filepath for a file corresponding to the dataset you are going to download. If it exists, it could immediately open up the file and return the saved contents. If not, it could download the contents from the REST API and save it to the file before returning the data. This means that the first time you run this function, it will automatically download and cache the data locally, and the next time you run the same function, it will instead load the local data. Consider using environment variables to allow each teammate to specify different locations, and having your function automatically retrieve the location specified by the environment variable so you don’t have to fight about paths in your git repository.

seasons: 2016,2017,2018,2019,2020 02 = regular season, 03 = playoffs,

The first 4 digits identify the season of the game (ie. 2017 for the 2017-2018 season). The next 2 digits give the type of game, where 01 = preseason, 02 = regular season, 03 = playoffs, 04 = all-star. The final 4 digits identify the specific game number. For regular season and preseason games, this ranges from 0001 to the number of games played. (1271 for seasons with 31 teams (2017 and onwards) and 1230 for seasons with 30 teams). For playoff games, the 2nd digit of the specific number gives the round of the playoffs, the 3rd digit specifies the matchup, and the 4th digit specifies the game (out of 7).

regular: combinations formed for 2016: year/02/0001to1230 combinations formed for 2017se2020: year/02/0001to1271

playoff: combinations formed for: year/03/four digits digit1=0 digit2=1/2/3/4 digit3=1-6/1-4/1-2/1 digit4=1/2/3/4/5/6/
The following code is used to downloaded the data.

```python
from urllib.request import urlopen
import json
import certifi
import pandas as pd
from urllib.error import HTTPError

def extract(year):

    playoff_code="0"+str(3);


#regular data file
    regular_code="0"+str(2);
    a=["%04d" % x for x in range(1230)]
    b=["%04d" % x for x in range(1271)]

    if(year==2016):
        for i in range(1,1231):
            code_r=str(a[i])
            url_r = "https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/"+str(year)+regular_code+code_r+"/feed/live/"
            response_r = urlopen(url_r,cafile=certifi.where())
            data_r = json.loads(response_r.read())
            df_r = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(data_r)
            file_name_r=str(year)+regular_code+code_r+".csv"
            df_r.to_csv (file_name_r, index = False, header=True)

    else:
        for i in range(1,1271):
            code_r=str(b[i])
            url_r = "https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/"+str(year)+regular_code+code_r+"/feed/live/"
            response_r = urlopen(url_r,cafile=certifi.where())
            data_r = json.loads(response_r.read())
            df_r = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(data_r)
            file_name_r=str(year)+regular_code+code_r+".csv"
            df_r.to_csv (file_name_r, index = False, header=True)


#playoff data file (in progress code)

    for digit2 in range(1,5):
        for digit3 in range(1,8):
            for digit4 in range(1,8):
                code_p="0"+str(digit2)+str(digit3)+str(digit4)
                #code_p="0256"
                url_p = "https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/"+str(year)+playoff_code+code_p+"/feed/live/"
                remove_url = requests.get(url_p)
                #print(remove_url.status_code)
                if (remove_url.status_code!=404):
                    response_p = urlopen(url_p,cafile=certifi.where())
                    #print(response_p.getcode())

                    data_p = json.loads(response_p.read())

                    df_p = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(data_p)
                    file_name_p=str(year)+playoff_code+code_p+".csv"
                    #print(digit2,digit3,digit4,file_name_p)
                    df_p.to_csv (file_name_p, index = False, header=True)
```

An example of using it to extract the data of the season 2016/2017 is :
```python
extract(2016)
```

## 4 - Simple Visualizations
### Shot types over all teams comparaison
![5-1](/assets/plot1.png)


We can see from the first graph that the "Wrist Shot" is by far
the most used shot by teams in the 2018/2019 season with almost 50,000 attempts.
However, this is not the most dangerous shot. Indeed, thanks to the second graph,
we can see that the "Tip-in" has a percentage of shots converted into goals of around 17%.
The "Wrist Shot" has only 9% conversion.
### relationship between the distance a shot was taken and the chance it was a goal
![5-1](/assets/plot2.png)
By comparing the goal ratios in relation to the number of shots we find that these are rather very similar over the 3 seasons from 2018 to 2021. Note that we have decided not to use the shots/goals data beyond 90ft because the number of shots was far too low and not representative in terms of the goals/shots conversion ratio.
### goal percentage
![5-1](/assets/plot3.png)
This heatmap allows us to observe the different ratios of goals scored compared to shots attempted for the 2018-2019 season according to two parameters: the distance of shots discretized over 15ft intervals and the type of shot attempted. It should be noted here again that we decided not to take into account shots beyond 90ft as well as configurations for which the number of shots was not greater than 30. These would have demonstrated potentially very high ratios and not representative of an entire season. Following this and thanks to the Heatmap type graph presented, we can identify the 2 most dangerous configurations: the "Slap Shot" and the "Snap Shot" at a maximum distance of 15ft. These have a conversion ratio of around 22%.
